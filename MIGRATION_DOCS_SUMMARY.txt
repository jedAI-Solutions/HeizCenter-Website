MIGRATION OVERVIEW
================================================================================

FROM:
  - Code: Local (Cursor) → jedAI GitHub → jedAI Vercel
  - Domain: heizcenter.de on Strato (old Odoo site)

TO:
  - Code: Local (Cursor) → HEIZcenter GitHub → HEIZcenter Vercel
  - Domain: heizcenter.de pointing to Vercel (new Next.js site)

TIMELINE: 2-3 weeks total
DOWNTIME: 5-30 minutes expected
COST: ~$22/month (Vercel Pro + domain)

================================================================================
GETTING STARTED
================================================================================

Step 1: Read MIGRATION_README.md (5 min)
  → Understand the package and approach

Step 2: Read MIGRATION_QUICK_START.md (15 min)
  → Make key decisions, review timeline

Step 3: Skim VERCEL_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md (30 min)
  → Understand detailed process

Step 4: Bookmark MIGRATION_COMMANDS.md
  → For reference during execution

Step 5: Review DNS_CONFIGURATION_REFERENCE.md (20 min)
  → Especially if unfamiliar with DNS

Step 6: Fill out decision tree in MIGRATION_QUICK_START.md
  → Choose: repo strategy, Vercel plan, timing

Step 7: Begin Phase 1 (Preparation)
  → Create accounts, document setup, verify access

================================================================================
KEY PHASES
================================================================================

Phase 1: Preparation (Day 1-2)
  - Create HEIZcenter Vercel account
  - Document current setup
  - Backup DNS records
  
Phase 2: Repository Migration (Day 2-3)
  - Transfer GitHub repo to HEIZcenter
  - Update local git remote
  - Grant developer access

Phase 3: Vercel Setup (Day 3-5)
  - Import project to HEIZcenter Vercel
  - Configure environment variables
  - Test on preview URL

Phase 4: DNS Preparation (Day 6)
  - Lower DNS TTL to 300 seconds
  - Wait 24 hours

Phase 5: DNS Migration (Day 7)
  - Update A record: @ → 76.76.21.21
  - Update CNAME: www → cname.vercel-dns.com
  - Monitor propagation (1-4 hours)

Phase 6: Verification (Day 7-8)
  - Test all critical paths
  - Verify SSL certificate
  - Test email send/receive
  - Monitor error rates

Phase 7: Monitoring (Day 7-14)
  - Daily checks (uptime, forms, errors)
  - Compare metrics to pre-migration
  - Increase DNS TTL after 7 days

Phase 8: Cleanup (Day 14+)
  - Decommission old jedAI Vercel project
  - Update documentation
  - Archive old Strato site

================================================================================
CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS
================================================================================

1. Email Preservation
   - Do NOT modify MX records during DNS migration
   - Verify: mx01.strato.de and mx02.strato.de intact
   - Test immediately after DNS change

2. n8n Webhook Integration
   - Verify N8N_WEBHOOK_BASE_URL in Vercel env vars
   - Test contact form on preview before DNS change
   - Monitor webhook delivery post-migration

3. Thorough Preview Testing
   - Test ALL critical paths on preview URL
   - Verify forms, navigation, images
   - Check mobile responsiveness
   - No shortcuts - this prevents production issues

4. DNS TTL Management
   - Lower TTL 24 hours BEFORE DNS change
   - Ensures fast propagation (5-60 min vs 4-24 hours)
   - Don't skip this step!

5. Monitoring & Communication
   - Monitor closely first 24-48 hours
   - Notify stakeholders of changes
   - Have rollback plan ready

================================================================================
ROLLBACK PLAN
================================================================================

If issues arise, can rollback DNS in 5-15 minutes:

1. Login to Strato DNS
2. Change A record back to old IP (from backup)
3. Change CNAME back to old value
4. Monitor: DNS reverts in 5-15 minutes (due to low TTL)
5. Verify old site loads

WHEN TO ROLLBACK:
  - Site completely down >30 minutes
  - Email completely broken
  - Critical functionality lost

See: VERCEL_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md Section 4 for detailed rollback
